# The first Makefile rule is the one that is evaluated when make is run 
# with no arguments.

# The target in this rule is the executable file name. The executable file 
# depends on the three object files which are compiled separately using the 
# rules below.  The action line in this rule links the three object files to 
# produce the executable file.

# The following three rules compile a single .c file into an object file.

# The clean target is a phony target because there is no file called clean
# It is a handy rule to remove the executabel and object files. For example,
# you might run "make clean" before git add and commit.
